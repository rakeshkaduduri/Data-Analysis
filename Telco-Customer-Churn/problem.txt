Customer Churn Prediction Analytics for a Telecom Company
A telecom operator named TeleConnect is facing customer churn (customers leaving the service).

Their data team wants to analyze customer behavior and produce a high-quality cleaned dataset for future ML modeling.
You are assigned to build a full ETL pipeline:

Extract → Transform → Load → Validate → Generate Analytics Summary.
 
EXTRACT (extract.py)
Write a script that:
Creates folder structure:
data/raw
data/staged
data/processed
import opendatasets as od
load the dataset
data/raw/churn_raw.csv
Save raw CSV as:data/raw/churn_raw.csv
 
TRANSFORM (transform.py)
must perform advanced transformations, not just cleaning.

✔ Cleaning Tasks
Convert "TotalCharges" to numeric (dataset has spaces → become NaN).
Fill missing numeric values using:
Median for tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges.
Replace missing categorical values with "Unknown".

✔ Feature Engineering
Create the following new columns:

1. tenure_group
Based on tenure months:
0–12   → "New"
13–36  → "Regular"
37–60  → "Loyal"
60+    → "Champion"

2. monthly_charge_segment
MonthlyCharges < 30  → "Low"
30–70              → "Medium"
> 70                 → "High"

3. has_internet_service
Convert InternetService column:
"DSL" / "Fiber optic" → 1
"No" → 0

4. is_multi_line_user
1 if MultipleLines == "Yes"
0 otherwise

5. contract_type_code
Map:
Month-to-month → 0
One year      → 1
Two year      → 2
✔ Drop unnecessary fields
Remove:
customerID, gender
✔ Save output to:
data/staged/churn_transformed.csv

VALIDATION SCRIPT (validate.py)
After load, write a script that checks:
No missing values in:
tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges
Unique count of rows = original dataset
Row count matches Supabase table
All segments (tenure_group, monthly_charge_segment) exist
Contract codes are only {0,1,2}
Print a validation summary.
